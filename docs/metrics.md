# Metrics

## ROI
ROI = (Net Profit) / (Total Amount Wagered)

## CLV
CLV = closing_line - line_at_pick_time (sign adjusted per over/under)

## Projection Accuracy
- MAE, RMSE by stat type
- Calibration for P(hit) (Brier score later)

## Dashboard Metrics & Notes
- The dashboard now displays summary metrics (ROI, CLV, Hit Rate) and auto-generated notes/factors for each pick.
- This improves transparency and allows users to understand the drivers behind each recommendation.
